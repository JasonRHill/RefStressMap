Final Ref Stress Site Map After Biologist Feedback

This script was built using R 4.1.2 (Bird Hippie). 

This tool allows users to see all the reference sites that have made it through reference screening filters
and have been reviewed by regional biologists from collections sampled 1994 to 2020. This analysis reviewed
3,098 sites (12,118 samples) and found 591 reference sites.
